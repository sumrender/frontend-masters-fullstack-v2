Monolith vs Microservices

Containers are even more watered down version
of VMs

Containerization: generally Docker
Orchestration: generally Kubernetes

Load Balancers:
  Scheduling algorithms:
    Round Robin
    IP hashing
    Random Choice
    Least connections
    Least load


Display Running Processes
$ top

// CAN INSTALL HTOP FOR BETTER UI
install htop
$ sudo apt install htop 

display running processes 
$ htop

NGINX as a load balancer
If we have 2 or more servers, we can add
use nginx as a load balancer, just google
it bruh, no need to write the code here


STICKY SESSIONS:
  probles of authorization


Deployments
  set up n number of servers in one go,
  instead of just manually doing it with 
  ssh key on your own, that'd be dumb

  tools like ansible, vagrant, puppet are used.


Why databases and not files to save data?
  Now you know the answer.

Websockets
  persistent bidirectional connection
  between client and server
